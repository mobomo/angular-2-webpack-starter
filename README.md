# Angular 2 Starter Kit with webpack

This project uses [Node 6.9.0](nodejs.org). Make sure you've got that installed before starting. If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), typing `nvm use` will automatically use version 6.9.0 if it's installed on your machine.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mobomo/angular-2-webpack-starter.git
$ cd angular-2-webpack-starter
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080.
